/*
I see the glaring similarities between balls and squares. However I have 0 energy and I am doing very bad this semester and I don't feel like doing this either.
I have nothing to look forward to or back to except for a lot of loan and low job prospects coupled with shit social life. I hate what I've become and I am not able to 
hold on any longer all by myself. This is too overwhelming.

In the summer hols I'll try fixing up Square spawning and try separating engine code from game code. I'll also try building the engine into a dll and making the game use it.
