My friend made a game about eating balls in python/pygame so I decided to spend the first half of my Sunday making a clone but in C++ / SFML so that I could get better at C++ and SFML and eating balls.


## Controls

1. W/D or arrow keys to move.

2. Esc / cross button / alt + f4 / power off button to quit

## System Requirments

**Required**
1. linux
2. GCC (if you want to build from source)

*If you want to build from source code. Check releases for the exe.

## Build Instructions (for linux)

``` 
git clone https://github.com/oh-facts/Eating-balls-in-cpp.git
```

Navigate into it and open console.

Run the following commands
```
git checkout linux
``` 
```
mkdir build
```
```
cd build
```
```
cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"
```
```
make all
```

You should have a Game file now.

If there are any errors.Stop making them.

Double click on the game file or ```./Game```
and you should be eating balls.

**For Windows, check other branch**

cheers,

facts
